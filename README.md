## Expected Behavior
In this custom video game titled "Weakness‚Äù, the player controls a triangular character that can use the directional buttons to move up and down and aim left or right (indicated by the direction the triangle is pointing), and the center button to eliminate an enemy or start the game if it is not currently running (indicated by the red screen). 
- Enemies appear on the sides of the screen in rows and attempt to reach the player in the center.
- The right 7-segment display (rightmost 4 digits) displays the number of successfully eliminated enemies. The left 7-segment display (leftmost 1 digit) displays the weakness number of the enemy the character is looking at.
- The character cannot eliminate an enemy unless exactly 1 of the switches is on (up). An enemy with a certain enemy number can only be destroyed by pressing the center button with that respective number switch on. 
- You lose when an enemy reaches the center of the screen, where the player is located, and the screen will turn red again. 
- A square-wave sound is played through the DAC module every time an enemy is eliminated. A lower-pitch sound is played when the game ends due to an enemy reaching the center of the screen.

## Attachments
- The Pmod I2S2 DAC module will play square-wave sound effects when the player successfully kills an enemy or when an enemy reaches the player when the game is over.
  - The module should be connected to PMOD port JA in the middle of the right side of the Nexys A7 board. 
- The female VGA connector will be connected to a display via a male VGA cable or the VGA to HDMI converter and will be used to output visuals of the player character and enemies.
  - Note: if the display supports audio, it is recommended to connect the DAC module output directly to the display's audio input, as the included DAC speaker is very quiet even at its maxiumu theoretical volume.

## Vivado and Nexys Upload Instructions 
1. Create a new RTL project called *weakness* in Vivado
2. Download and import all `.vhd` source files from the GitHub page as source files to the project.
3. Download and import `weakness.xdc` as a constraints file to the project.
4. Choose Nexys A7-100T as the board utilized in the project. (Click 'Finish' afterwards) 
5. Run Synthesis
6. Run Implementation
7. Generate Bitstream
8. Open Hardware Manager, click Auto Connect, and Program Device followed by the device.
9. Ensure that all attachments and supplementary hardware, including the external display/speakers are on and functioning, and that they are properly connected to the device in accordance with the Attachments section.
10. The game should enter its initial state by displaying a red screen.

## Starting Code
No lab code was directly started from, preferring to write the project from scratch to avoid errors. However, many vhd files were used for general setup of displays and peripherals. The Pong lab was used to set up the vga_sync, leddec16, clk_wiz_0, and clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz for the VGA and 7-segment display. Files from lab 5 tone and dac_if were reused to provide simple sound effects. Finally, the constraint file was built from prior documentation of the Nexys board with inputs added and taken away based on what was required.

### Changes:
Leddec16- anodes 4, 5, and 6 were removed so the weakness value would be separated from the 4-digit score.

tone- The modified square wave was chosen to output sound effects and the pitch was changed based on player or enemy death.
weakness.xdc- All 4 VGA color bits are defined when controlling the VGA to have access to more vivid colors.
